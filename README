This repository holds the code for the Django-powered website and and the Python and R data processing files.  

PROCS FOLDER 
This is a folder of = code that processes the raw wifi data.  There are three files.
The visit_creation.py file defines most of the functions used to firstly create objects such as walkbys and visits,
and secondly to create the aggregate statistics for the outlets.
The exclude.py simply removes certain mac addresses e.g of other routers, consumer who wanted to opt out.
The duration.py file defines an R function (that is wrapped in such a way that it can be called in a Python program) that computes
the length of a visit.

DASHBOARD:  This is a Djanjo application for the analytics, containing the models.py and views.py that executes the bulk of the processing for the website.
EMAILUSERNAMES: This app enables the website to take email addresses as usernames.
TEMPLATES: This contains all the HTML files for the project.

SCRIPTS FOLDER (FOR DELETION)
This is junk code, composed of files that provided earlier versions of what is now in the Procs folder.
